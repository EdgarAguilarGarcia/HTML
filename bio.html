                    If you're reading this, I think you are actually interested in what I'm doing; My name is Edgar
                    Aguilar, student of an engineer in informatic systems. My history isn't that interesting, but all I
                    can say is that I think I choose the wrong career, lately I've been feeling down, and sometimes I
                    don't know what to do. Usually I get over this saying things like "I'm young, I can do it" but even
                    if I lie to myself, it's pretty hard. However! I'll do my best, and hopefully someday I'll be able
                    to reach my dream to became an artist.
