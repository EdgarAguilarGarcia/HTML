                    The purpose of this project is creating a viable option for a digital portfolio, this making use of
                    simple html and css code. Whereas I learn how to create some simple online page; right now I don't
                    know what I'm doing, but I know everyone needs to start from cero, so, here I am.
                    I really hope this gets read by someone who actually cares for my education, and all this being
                    said... Welcome!

                    The principal mission of this html homework is developing a digital form of a curriculum, a place
                    where I can show what I can offer to people that are interested in my abilities and skills. The use
                    of html and css style sheets is almost indispensible to fulfill the requirements of this practice.
                    Some personal information is shown as intended, so, for god's sake, do not share any of the
                    information shown within the project

            <td>
                <h2 class="patabla">

                    As a simple homework, I do not expect some crazy results at the end of this practice, hopefully I
                    can learn how to use some simple tables in html and how to use css as an option to create visually
                    interesting digital media. And hopefully I can secretly put some easter eggs along the page.
